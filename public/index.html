      <h1>Web3 Community Tools</h1>
    </header>

    <main>
      <p>
        The web3 tooling ecosystem is both fragmented and rapidly evolving. This
        makes it hard for dapp developers to quickly discern optimum and
        high-quality tools.
      </p>

      <p>
        The other issue is a lot of tools are maintained by individuals who should
        not be relied upon to review pull requests and address issues in a timely
        manner. Multiple maintainers are needed to iterate frequently and provide
        ongoing support.
      </p>

      <p>
        In other ecosystems, organisations have been created to house
        unofficially-approved tools and permit multiple people to act as
        maintainers, such as <a href="https://github.com/reactjs/">reactjs</a> and
        <a href="https://github.com/webpack-contrib">webpack-contrib</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        <a href="https://github.com/web3">web3</a> is such an
        organisation for the Ethereum/web3 community. The organisation's goal is
        to become the place to go for web3 tools, best-practices and trends.
      </p>

      <p>
        The first step to realising this goal is to gather input from tool
        consumers and tool creators, alongside releasing some early experiments.
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          If you are a dapp developer or smart contract author let us know what
          tools you would like to see built.
        </li>
        <li>
          If you are interested in contributing code and time to this mission
          it'd be great to have a chat.
        </li>
